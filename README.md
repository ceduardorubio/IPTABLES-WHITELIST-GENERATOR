# WHITELISTS BY COUNTRIES
Use this script to easily allow request only from the countries you choose.

Edit config.js as you want and execute IT, and it will generate a script "iptables.sh" in the current directory, with de iptables rules.

The ip ranges list is from ip2location.com.
Don't forget to add your ip and port you need to access to your server [like your ssh port]
