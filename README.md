# IPTABLES WHITELIST GENERATOR
Use this tool to create a iptables script and easily allow request to your server only from the countries you choose(countries whitelist). You will need to execute the resulting script inside the server you want to protect (server target)

The ip ranges list is from ip2location.com.
Don't forget to include[if is not included in the ranges] your ip and port you need to access to your server [like your ssh port]

IMPORTANT: The rules generated are related ONLY to the selected countries and ports .

## USE
### Start Iptables Whitelist Generator
- Only with specific ip addresses, no countries prompt
```bash
    iptables-whitelist 
```



- with prompt for allowing countries 
```bash
    iptables-whitelist  --countries
```
- with countries prompt, update current IP2Location file, and save the IP2Location File  in current directory (/lib) 
```bash
    iptables-whitelist --countries --update --local
```
- 
### Select the ports you want to ALLOW/DENY access to
Type the ports you want to protect. Example: 22, 80

```bash 
Enter the port(s) separated by coma (,). [Example: 22,80,443,3306]:
22,80
```
### ALLOW SPECIFIC IPs
Type the ip addresses you need to allow access to the ports, like your computer o other servers that will be connected to the server in which you will add these iptables rules. Example if your target server is a mysql server and second server will connect to it, you have to add to these list the ip address of the second server.

If you are in the same local network than your target server, you will need to add your local ip address. 

If you access yor target server remotely, you need to add you public ip address ( MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PUBLIC IP ADDRESS IS STATIC)

In the next example the target server(mysql server) will be access for the admin via ssh from a computer in the same LAN with the target server and will be access remotely to read/write data using a mysql client
- LAN Ip - target server: 192.168.5.3
- WAN Ip - target server: 7.7.7.7
- Local Ip admin: 192.168.5.2
- WAN Ip remote server: 10.10.10.10
```bash
Enter the IP PUBLIC Addresses you want to EXPLICITLY ALLOW ACCESS TO ALL PORTS REMOTELY, no matter the country.
Enter the IP Addresses separated by coma (,). [Example: 1.1.1.1,8.8.8.8]
Don't forget to enter the public ip addresses of the devices you will use to access to your server
Or if you are in the same LAN with the server, add your local ip address too. (like 192.168.xxx.xxx)
You can get your public IP Address from https://www.whatismyip.com/ or your local ip using your system network manager.
  [default: no ip addresses]:
192.168.5.2,10.10.10.10
```

### Select COUNTRY CODE ( --countries | -c)
When you execute it with the countries option ( iptables-whitelist --countries ), the prompt will show the list of codes and countries available and ask you to type the codes of the country you want to allow access to the previous added ports. All ip address will be able to access the ports you add in the previous step.
```bash 
AD - Andorra
AE - United Arab Emirates
AF - Afghanistan
AG - Antigua and Barbuda
AI - Anguilla
AL - Albania
AM - Armenia
... 
US - United States of America
UY - Uruguay
UZ - Uzbekistan
VA - Holy See
VC - Saint Vincent and The Grenadines
VE - Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)
VG - Virgin Islands (British)
VI - Virgin Islands (U.S.)
VN - Viet Nam
VU - Vanuatu
WF - Wallis and Futuna
WS - Samoa
YE - Yemen
YT - Mayotte
ZA - South Africa
ZM - Zambia
ZW - Zimbabwe

Enter the countries codes separated by coma (,).[Example: US,GB ]:
US
[ 22, 80 ] [ 'EC' ]

```

```bash
    scp iptables_cwDateTimeNumber.sh user@yourServerIp:/the/path/ofYour/selection
```

## Execute Script inside the Server
```bash
    ssh user@yourServerIp
    #inside the server
    cd /the/path/ofYour/selection
    # read the script to make sure your ip address is allow to access de server
    # the user should have privileges (root, sudoers)
    bash iptables_cwDateTimeNumber.sh
